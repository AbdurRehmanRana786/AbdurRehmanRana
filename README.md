Hi there! I am a software engineer with expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, VueJs, React Js, PHP, and MySQL. I love learning and expanding my knowledge, which is why I am always on the lookout for new things to learn. As a software engineer, I am passionate about creating innovative and efficient solutions that make a difference. When I am not busy coding, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, reading books, and exploring new places. Thanks for reading!
